Update manager for as many package managers possible

## Why?

Too many times there's some package manager that one forgets about and packages and/or caches gets very outdated.
Why not have a daemon keeping track of all these packages?

## Where?

My idea is to have a daemon keeping track of all package managers in the system. On a global level, meaning that I intend this to be able to upgrade with patches to system kernel or versionning in projects.
This is made for, but not limited to, workstations. But I would _not_ recommend using this tool for production environments.

## Can I help?

Yes, please! I am hoping for people to help out as much as possible. If it is to fix bugs, contribute with code for additional package managers etc.
