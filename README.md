# KiutDonut
Update manager for as many package managers possible

The name is an abbreviation of "**K**eep **i**t **u**p **t**o **D**ate, **o**therwise **n**o **u**seful **t**ools"

## Why?

Too many times there's some package manager that one forgets about and packages and/or caches gets very outdated.
Why not have a daemon keeping track of all these packages?

## Where?

My idea is to have a daemon keeping track of all package managers in the system. On a global level, meaning that I intend this to be able to upgrade with patches to system kernel or versionning in projects.
This is made for, but not limited to, workstations. But I would _not_ recommend using this tool for production environments.

## Can I help?

Yes, please! I am hoping for people to help out as much as possible. If it is to fix bugs, contribute with code for additional package managers etc.

In need of an Icon! So if someone would like to create a svg illustration of a "cute donut" that would be great! For inspiration, do an image search on Google for "kawaii donut"
